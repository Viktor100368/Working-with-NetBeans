Had I the heavens embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
Thre blude and thre dim of the dark cloths
Of might and light and the half-light,
I would spred the cloths under your feet:
But I being poor have only my dreams:
I hava spread my dreams under your feet:
Tread softly, becaude you tread on my dreams.
				William Butler Yeats
 Threre are only two vays to live your life.One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is asthough everything is a miracle.
